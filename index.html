        <h4>
          Kingdom Watcher is the ultimate blend of tower defense and
          bow and arrow shooter. Inspired by Valve's <i>The Lab - Longbow</i>,
          players must defend their castle from the onslaught of the Troll King's army.
          Players can build and upgrade towers like a traditional TD game, but are also
          equipped with their own bow and arrow to take out enemies. I designed and built Kingdom
          Watcher from the ground up with minimal engineering support from Subdream
          Studios. All the art assets were done by Kanji Fukuta of Subdream Studios.
          Built with Unity - C#. Kingdom Watcher is available on GearVR and has been played over 7000 times.

        <h4>
          SocialQ is an assistive technology that
          helps children affected by ASD (Autism-Spectrum Disorder)
          to better recognize facial expressions and social cues.
          SocialQ utilizes Microsoft's Augmented Reality Headset <i>HoloLens</i>
          to provide real-time and real-world assistance and training. There
          are two interfaces: a learning interface, where the user can ask the
          app what certain expressions look like, and an assistance interface, where the
          user can figure out what the other person's expressions reveal about their emotions.
          Built using Microsoft Emotion API, Windows Speech Recognition, and Unity SDK for HoloLens.
          Won <i> Best Use of Microsoft Technology </i> at UC Berkeley's Hackathon: CalHacks 3.0.
          Also a U.S Microsoft Imagine Cup National Finalist.
          All demo footage is shot live through the HoloLens.

        <h4>
          Lunasphere is a platform for the next generation
          of informational content about real world objects.
          Currently, the Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara uses Lunasphere to
          publish multimedia content, which its patrons can
          access through QR Code or through an exhibit look up.
          I built Lunasphere from the ground up using Angular and
          JQuery for the front-end, and AngularFire, Firebase, and Javascript
          for the backend.
